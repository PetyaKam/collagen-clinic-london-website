# 🚀 Deployment Status

## ✅ What I've Done

1. ✅ **Enabled GitHub Pages** - Your site is configured at:
   - **URL:** https://petyakam.github.io/collagen-clinic-london-website/
   - **Status:** Building (may take 2-5 minutes)

2. ✅ **Created GitHub Actions workflows** for automatic deployment to:
   - Vercel (when you add VERCEL_TOKEN secret)
   - Netlify (when you add NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN secret)

3. ✅ **Added .nojekyll file** to ensure proper static site serving

4. ✅ **All code pushed to GitHub**

## 🌐 Your Live Site

**GitHub Pages URL:** https://petyakam.github.io/collagen-clinic-london-website/

⚠️ **Note:** GitHub Pages may take 2-5 minutes to build and deploy. If you see an error, it's likely still building.

## 🔄 Alternative: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended - Faster)

Since GitHub Pages can be slow, here's how to deploy to Vercel instantly:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new
2. Click "Import Git Repository"
3. Select: `collagen-clinic-london-website`
4. Click "Deploy"
5. Your site will be live in 30 seconds!

Vercel is faster and better for static sites. Your site will be at:
`https://collagen-clinic-london-website.vercel.app`
