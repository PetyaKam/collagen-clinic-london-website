                    Dr Oliver Zolman MBBS BSc is a leading longevity doctor and scientist specialising in evidence-based longevity and rejuvenation medicine. A graduate of King's College London, he holds a First Class Honours degree in Regenerative Medicine and completed a Visiting Fellowship in Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Sydney.

                <p class="hero-description">
                    Dr Zolman is at the forefront of ageing research, aiming to reverse biological ageing across all 81 organ types, including skin. At Collagen Clinic London, Dr Zolman and his team use cutting-edge diagnostics, advanced imaging, and evidence-based protocols to skincare. We don't just treat your skin - we measure, slow, and reduce its biological age, regardless of your chronological age. Why? Because most skin concerns, like thinning, wrinkles, dryness, pigmentation, sagging volume and elasticity loss, are skin ageing. Rejuvenation is ageing backwards.

He gave me a treatment plan of topicals, which has almost completely removed it. Most derms use liquid nitrogen which can leave scarring. If this is what he can do over a digital consult before opening his clinic, I'm excited to see what he can do in person!"</p>
