                                With a unique blend of clinical expertise, customer experience insight, and digital influence, Dr. Vikram Ravoory (Dr. Vik) brings a fresh perspective to the world of marketing. Trained as a dentist at NYU College of Dentistry, with a surgical fellowship at NYU, he currently practices in West Palm Beach, Florida, while also consulting and collaborating with brands at the intersection of healthcare, lifestyle, and consumer engagement.

                            <p class="founder-description">
                                Early in his career, he worked at Disney World, where he learned the gold standard of customer service, a principle he now applies in both patient care and brand strategy. He focuses on creating a highly personal, luxury experience, while also recognising that people cannot spend all their time in a doctor's office, so he ensures the care is efficient, seamless, and respectful of patients' time. That balance of excellence and efficiency has fueled his growth beyond the dental chair into a thriving career as a social media creator and strategist.

His ability to authentically connect with audiences has made him a trusted collaborator for companies seeking to bridge healthcare, lifestyle, and consumer culture. His work has also been featured in USA Today, Business Insider, and Travel + Leisure.

                                Beyond content creation, he provides consulting expertise to healthcare companies, helping them craft strategies that resonate with both patients and consumers. His passion for travel also led him to take on a leadership role as the head of the creator program at Globe Thrivers, a revolutionary app empowering global citizens to share and connect.
